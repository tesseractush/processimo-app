Develop a full-stack AI automation SaaS platform where users can subscribe to AI agents, request workflow customizations, and manage their automation workflows. The platform should support role-based access, tiered pricing, real-time suggestions, and subscription-based billing. Deployment will use Docker containers and a CI/CD pipeline for automation.

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 1: Set Up Full-Stack Development Environment (Dockerized)

ðŸ”¹ Backend:

âœ… Use FastAPI as the backend framework
âœ… Implement OAuth2 authentication with JWT (for secure user authentication)
âœ… Set up SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL as the database
âœ… Configure Celery + Redis for background task processing

ðŸ”¹ Frontend:

âœ… Use React.js + TailwindCSS for a modern, scalable UI
âœ… Implement React Router for seamless navigation
âœ… Use Redux (or Zustand) for state management

ðŸ”¹ Docker Configuration:

âœ… Create a Dockerfile for the backend
âœ… Create a Dockerfile for the frontend
âœ… Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container deployment

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 2: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Authentication

âœ… Set up User Roles:
	â€¢	Admin â†’ Can manage AI agents, approve requests, monitor user activity
	â€¢	User â†’ Can subscribe to AI agents, request custom workflows

âœ… Secure API routes using OAuth2 Scopes & JWT tokens
âœ… Implement Google & GitHub OAuth login

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 3: Develop Core AI Agent Management System

âœ… Admin Dashboard Features:
	â€¢	Add, update, and delete AI agents
	â€¢	Configure n8n workflows for automation
	â€¢	View & manage user activity and subscriptions

âœ… User Dashboard Features:
	â€¢	Browse available AI agents
	â€¢	Subscribe to AI agents
	â€¢	View active subscriptions & workflow execution history

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 4: Implement Subscription Model & Billing System

âœ… Use Stripe API for handling recurring payments
âœ… Implement subscription-based AI agent access (Monthly/Annual plans)
âœ… Allow prorated pricing for upgrades (Users only pay the difference)

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 5: Enable AI Workflow Customization Requests

âœ… Users can request custom workflows
âœ… Implement Tiered Pricing Model based on complexity:
	â€¢	Basic â†’ Simple 3-step workflows
	â€¢	Advanced â†’ Multi-step workflows with integrations
	â€¢	Enterprise â†’ Complex workflows with multiple integrations & API calls

âœ… Real-time auto-suggestions for upgrades when users exceed limits
âœ… Ensure manual approval is required before upgrading

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 6: Build the User Dashboard & Marketplace

âœ… User Dashboard:
	â€¢	View & manage active AI agents & subscriptions
	â€¢	Upgrade workflows if needed

âœ… AI Agent Marketplace:
	â€¢	Discover & purchase AI agents
	â€¢	Users can list & sell User-Generated AI Agents

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 7: Implement Interactive Onboarding & Use Cases

âœ… Step-by-step onboarding guide to help users set up their first AI agent
âœ… Pre-built industry-specific automation templates

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 8: Develop Community & Collaboration Features

âœ… User-Generated AI Agents: Users can create & sell AI agents
âœ… Team Collaboration: Teams can share & manage AI agents together
âœ… Workflow Versioning: Users can revert to previous versions

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 9: Add Final UI Enhancements & Navigation

âœ… Vertical Navigation Bar with:
	â€¢	Home
	â€¢	AI Agents
	â€¢	Marketplace
	â€¢	Agent Teams
	â€¢	Profile
	â€¢	Billing
	â€¢	Contact
	â€¢	Privacy & Terms

âœ… Mobile responsiveness & UI/UX optimization

â¸»

ðŸš€ Step 10: Set Up CI/CD Pipeline with Docker for Deployment

âœ… Create CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
âœ… Automate builds & deployments with Docker & Kubernetes
âœ… Deploy backend & frontend as separate microservices on Hostinger VPS
âœ… Implement SSL & Security Best Practices

â¸»

ðŸ’¡ Expected Outcome

After following these 10 steps, you will have:
âœ… A fully functional AI automation SaaS platform
âœ… Secure authentication with OAuth2 & JWT
âœ… AI agent marketplace & workflow customization
âœ… Subscription-based billing with Stripe
âœ… Dockerized deployment with CI/CD automation
